Hey everyone, hope you enjoyed the session today! 
Project steps:
- Data modeling 
    - objects e.g. user, post, ..
    - attributes e.g. id, name, … 
    - attribute types e.g. string, int, …
- API Design
    - API e.g. GET /moods
    - Inputs and outputs
    - Description of what is does internally
- Creating python data models
    - You can use a 3rd party library if you want
- Creating python api structure using fast api
- Integrating with sqlite

Requirements:
- Get mood entries
- Create a mood entry given an image

Example API:
- GET /moods
- POST /mood
    - Takes an image
    - Stores an image on disk
    - Calls the model with the image and gets a mood response
    - Creates a new entry with the image path, model response and user id
    - This can be separated into multiple APIs

For the Task they need to:
1. implement registration and login flaws for user with salting support.
2. use JWT tokens for authorization.
3. Input validation and sanitization.
